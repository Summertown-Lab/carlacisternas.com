<p align="justify">I am an MA (1st) in Political Science from the <a href="http://www.inap.uchile.cl/" target="_blank">Institute for Public Affairs</a> at the Universidad de Chile. My thesis was supported by the Chilean Formation of Advanced Human Capital Programme and focuses on the legislative networks in the Chilean congress during the democratic post-transition. Prior to starting my MA, I earned a BA (1st) in Public Administration from the Universidad de Santiago, where I was a teaching assistant.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, I work as both research and editorial assistant in research projects funded by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development and at the <a href="http://www.revistadegestionpublica.cl/index.php/rgp" target="_blank">RGP journal</a>, respectively. I am interested in legislative studies and Latin American congresses, technocracy, social network analysis, and mixed methods.</p>
