I am an MA in Political Science student (viva voce expected this 2020) in the Institute for Public Affairs at the Universidad de Chile. My thesis has been supported by the Chilean Formation of Advanced Human Capital Programme and focuses on the legislative networks in the Chilean congress during the democratic post-transition. Prior to starting my MA, I earned a BA (1st) in Public Administration from the Universidad de Santiago, where I worked as a teaching assistant.

Currently, I work as both research and editorial assistant in research projects funded by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development and at the RGP journal, respectively. I am interested in legislative studies and Latin American congresses, technocracy, social network analysis, and mixed methods.
