<p align="justify">I am a Lecturer in the School of Business at the <a href="https://www.umayor.cl/um/facultades/humanidades/10000" target="_blank">Faculty of Humanities</a> at the Universidad Mayor, Chile. Moreover, I work in research projects funded by the Chilean National Agency of Research and Development, and I am a member of the editorial team at the RGP journal. </p>

<p align="justify">I hold an MA (1st) in Political Science from the <a href="http://www.inap.uchile.cl/" target="_blank">Institute for Public Affairs</a>  at the Universidad de Chile. My thesis was supported by the Chilean Formation of Advanced Human Capital Programme and focused on the Chilean congress's legislative networks during the democratic post-transition. Prior to starting my MA, I earned a BA (1st) and a BPS (1st) in Public Administration from the Universidad de Santiago, where I worked as a teaching and research assistant.</p>

<p align="justify">I am interested in technocracy in Latin America, public policies and legislative processes, social network analysis, and mixed methods.</p>
